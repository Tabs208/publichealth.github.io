Climate change, in the most basic terms, is a significant shift in our planet's typical weather patterns.

Climate change refers to changes in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and a host of other meteorological elements, which might make your head spin faster than weather vane in a storm.
